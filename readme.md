# Face Detection and Filter Application (OpenCV)

This project is a real-time webcam-based face detection and filtering application built using Python and OpenCV. It demonstrates how classic computer vision techniques can be used for interactive media applications.

## Features

- Real-time webcam feed processing
- Face detection using Haar cascade classifiers
- Multiple visual filters:
  - Grayscale
  - Gaussian Blur
  - Canny Edge Detection
  - Cartoon Effect
- Screenshot saving with applied filters
- Keyboard shortcuts for quick filter toggling

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV 4.x
- Haar cascade classifiers
